The limitations of my solution is that it is confined by the data types that I predefine. This is because using cin to get the input, I would get the type as a char or string. That is why I must use if statements or something similar to check if the input matches a certain type. As far as I am aware, most other programming languages would require you to check this way since they ususally take inputs similarly. There also does not seem to be a way to check the size of a certain type given a string as you would get the size of the string instead. I think python might be able to do it better since you do not have to declare types in python. For example, you could create a dictionary mapping the string to each corresponding type.
